/**
 * The items the recommendation rests on, each with two things the reviewer can
 * change — how much it matters, and what it argues for. A dot before each title
 * carries the call's colour so the column reads at a glance.
 *
 * ## Adding one is a form, not a blank row
 *
 * It used to append an item to the store and render a lone name field inside it.
 * The composer (./EvidenceComposer.tsx) replaced that and says why at length; what
 * matters here is where it goes. **Adding opens it at the foot of the list, where
 * the row will be. Editing opens it over the row being edited.** One component,
 * two mounts, so the two can never drift apart — and in both cases it is IN the
 * list rather than over it, because the thing being written is a row and a modal
 * would hide the rows it has to sit beside.
 *
 * `editing` and `adding` are one piece of state, not two booleans: the composer is
 * a single-occupancy slot, and two of them open at once is a state worth making
 * unrepresentable rather than remembering not to cause.
 *
 * ## A row is one line until you ask it for more
 *
 * Every item used to print its whole case whether anybody was reading it or not —
 * 111px a row, and three of them filled the card. Shut, a row is 48px: a chevron,
 * the call's dot, the title, and the two controls. The note, what it backs and
 * where it came from are one press away, which is where content belongs on a
 * surface whose first act is to scan a column and its second is to read one item.
 *
 * **Everything opens shut, the agent's items included.** Opening the most important
 * one was the obvious alternative and is worse: a list with one row open for a
 * reason nobody stated reads as a bug rather than as a hint.
 *
 * ## The reviewer's own rows are marked, and only those can be touched
 *
 * A chip beside the title, and Edit / Remove in the opened body. The agent's items
 * carry neither: they are the record this decision is being taken against, and a
 * list where any row could be deleted is one where "three items" stops meaning
 * anything.
 *
 * ## A standing hazard in this app, since two passes have now hit it
 *
 * It ships a PREBUILT stylesheet (../../../warranty-console/warranty-console.css —
 * a build artifact shared with v1) nested inside `.wrc`, and the shell's Tailwind
 * ALSO compiles these files. Both emit at the same specificity, so where they
 * collide the console's sheet wins by source order — which is why a shell-only
 * variant over a base class the console also has silently loses. It cost this file
 * a `group-hover:` reveal that was invisible at every state. What is safe: a class
 * the console sheet already contains, an arbitrary value nothing competes with, or
 * a conditional class through `cn` (it is `twMerge`, so only one survives). What is
 * not: assuming a variant applies because it type-checks. `rotate-90` is absent and
 * `rotate-180` is present, which is why the chevron flips rather than turns.
 */
/* THE TWO CONTROL COLUMNS live in ./evidenceColumns.ts, with the measurements
   that produced their widths. They moved out of this file because three things
   have to agree on those edges — the headings below, every row, and the
   composer's own line — and this file already imports the composer, so it
   cannot be the one that owns them. */
/**
 * THE COLUMN HEADINGS, as the band's own right-hand side.
 *
 * The compact trigger dropped the captions the form variant has and replaced them
 * with a hover hint, so the two columns are unlabelled until a reviewer thinks to
 * hover one. A heading says it without the hover — and once the columns are named,
 * their fixed edges read as a table rather than as ragged space.
 *
 * **`gap-2.5` HERE, not on the `Band`.** The headings only line up over the
 * controls if the space between them is the space between the cells, and that is
 * `FoldRow`'s `gap-2.5` (10px) — `Band`'s own gap is 12px, which would put the
 * Relevance heading 2px off its column. Grouping the two in one node keeps the
 * band's gap for the title/aside split and the row's gap for the columns. The
 * horizontal padding is shared: both use `px-3.5`.

             The prose went with the ground. A person glyph followed by a name
             already says somebody put this here, and only the reviewer's own rows
             carry it — so "Added by" was two words spelling out what the mark
             means rather than adding to it. `aria-label` keeps the sentence for a
             reader who cannot see the glyph.

             FILLED, not the outline. A hairline person at 12px against 10.5px
             type reads as a smudge; a solid one reads as a mark. `strokeWidth={0}`
             matters as much as the fill — lucide draws strokes, so filling alone
