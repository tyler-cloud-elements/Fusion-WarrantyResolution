/**
 * THE TWO ESTABLISHED CAUSES, and what follows from them.
 *
 * **A group inside the CASE card, not a card of its own.** This returns a `Rows`
 * panel and ./CaseFacts.tsx owns the card — what was established about a claim
 * reads as part of the claim, not as a box beside it.
 *
 * It was banded with the evidence in a shared `Case info` card until the decision
 * moved to the top of its own section and took the evidence with it. That card's
 * argument was that the finding and the evidence are one subject in two parts and a
 * reader crosses between them constantly, which was true; what it could not also do
 * was leave the evidence next to the decision it feeds. The rows below carry the
 * same band, the same `FoldRow` and the same three verdict colours, so the colour
 * language reads the same; it just no longer runs into the evidence list's copy.
 *
 * **The rows are `FoldRow`, the same line the evidence list is made of**, with the
 * dot before the title carrying the side the cause points to: green for the one
 * that points at cover, red for the one that points away. That is deliberately the
 * vocabulary the evidence rows use for a call — close but not identical, since red
 * there means *deny* and red here means *this argues against cover*. One colour
 * language over both lists is worth the slight stretch: a reader who has learned
 * the column once has learned it everywhere.
 *
 * **It used to use Radix `Collapsible`, and it now holds its own open state.** Not
 * because the old chevron was broken — it was not. The claim that it never turned
 * came from reading `getComputedStyle().transform`, which is the wrong property:
 * Tailwind v4 writes `rotate-*` to the standalone `rotate` property, and measured
 * there the same pattern in ./primitives.tsx `Section` reports `90deg` exactly as
 * written. The reason to hold the state here is `FoldRow`: its rows carry controls
 * that must sit outside the toggle, which is easier as plain state than as a
 * `Collapsible` per row.

/**
 * THE CONCLUSION, IN THE TITLE BAR — a chip, not a block under the rows.
 *
 * It was an inset alert at the foot of the group: a rimmed, primary-washed box
 * holding one sentence. Correct in colour and wrong in shape — a full-width box
 * directly under two cause rows has the silhouette of a third cause row, so the
 * section's judgement read as one more item in the list it was judging. Moved up
 * beside the heading it belongs to, it costs the card **80px** (the group measures
 * 145px against 225px) and it stops competing with its own rows.
 *
 * **A chip rather than plain text, and that is the whole reason it is a component.**
 * This is the one thing on that bar which is not a heading, and 12px text beside a
 * 14px semibold title just reads as a subtitle. The pill marks it as a different
 * KIND of object. It also keeps the wash and the glyph the alert established, so a
 * reader who learned that box has nothing to unlearn.
 *
 * **`/10` and `/30`, because those are the steps that exist.** `bg-primary/[0.06]`
 * is emitted nowhere — not by the shell's Tailwind, not by the prebuilt `.wrc`
 * sheet — and `border-primary/25` falls through to the plain border colour. Both
 * measured on the running page; see ./EvidenceList.tsx on why a class in this
 * folder is only real if one of the two stylesheets already contains it.
 *
 * **The headline's trailing comma is trimmed here, not in the data.**
 * `verdict.headline` is authored as "No rule covers both causes," precisely so the
 * old box could run it into `detail` as one sentence. The chip is a label, so it
 * takes the clause off — but the fixture keeps its wording, because the string is
 * still one sentence for anything else that reads it and rewriting it there would
 * fight an edit in flight.
 *
 * **The clause is not thrown away, it moves to the hover.** "as they point towards
 * opposite decisions" is the REASON no rule covers both, which is worth keeping and
 * is not worth a line of the card. Chip as the marker, sentence on hover — the same
 * split `RecommendedTag` uses on the decision below (./decision/DecisionSection.tsx).

          the shared `TooltipContent` was illegible without it. That was true of the
          host this screen was embedded in: there, the content portals to
          `document.body` outside a `.wrc` theme root, and `text-background` did not
          emit at all out there, so the label inherited near-black ink onto a
          near-black panel. `app-text` / `app-card` were the SHELL'S paired tokens
          and the only two that resolved.

          Neither token exists in this app — and `cn` is tailwind-merge, so passing
          `bg-app-text` did not add a background, it DELETED the base
          `bg-foreground` and put nothing in its place. Every tooltip on this screen
          was rendering with no background at all. Removed, the base
