/**
 * A captioned select whose trigger shows the value's own icon.
 *
 * IT FITS ITS OWN VALUE, and the reflow that costs is absorbed by where it sits.
 *
 * This is a reversal. It used to hold the width of its longest label so nothing
 * moved on a change — which was right about the reflow and wrong about the result:
 * on `Approve` inside a box sized for `Partially approve` the chevron sat about
 * 90px from the word, and a left-aligned label with a right-pinned chevron reads as
 * a half-empty form field rather than a value. The dead space cost more than the
 * movement did.
 *
 * What makes fitting safe is the ROW, not this component: the two controls sit in a
 * right-anchored cluster (`ml-auto` in ../EvidenceList.tsx), so one that grows grows
 * LEFTWARD into the row's empty middle. Every row's right edge stays put and nothing
 * after it moves. Left-align that cluster and this decision becomes wrong again.
 *
 * **Stable is now MEASURED rather than declared.** It used to be a `width` prop the
 * call site typed — 96px for importance in a row, 124 for the call, 126 and 168 in
 * the composer — and every one of those four was too small for its own longest
 * option: at 96px the text gets 36px, which fits `Low` (28) and `High` (32) and
 * truncates `Medium` (53) and `Not relevant` (81). `Partially approve` (113)
 * truncated in all four. The trigger sizes itself to the widest label it could ever
 * hold now (see the sizer at the label span), so `width` is a floor and truncation
 * is impossible rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * **`null` is a value it can hold**, and it draws as the placeholder with no icon
 * and no emphasis. It used to fall back to `options[0]` for anything it did not
 * recognise, which is fine for a bad id and wrong for "nobody has chosen": the
 * trigger would print `High` over an item whose importance nobody had set. An
 * unmade choice has to look unmade — see `EvidenceItem` in ../../lib/coverage/fixture.ts.
