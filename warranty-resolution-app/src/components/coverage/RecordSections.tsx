 * with a 56px head carrying a 16px title, so the five blocks read as five of one
 * thing rather than as two cards and three strips. Each body lays its facts out in
 * rows of one rhythm rather than in three unrelated shapes — a paragraph over a
 * stacked bar over a table, a 180px-gutter key/value table, and seven four-line
 * blocks with a bordered button each.
 *
 * **Compacting these was worth more than compacting anything else on the page.**
 * Open, they came to 1,093px between them — Documents alone was 578, larger than
 * the whole Decision card. They now come to 614.

/** One fact, as a line: name left, value right. The evidence list's own rhythm. */
/**
 * ONE FACT, AND — WHERE THE SECTION CAN PRODUCE A READING — A WAY TO FILE IT.
 *
 * `onAdd` is optional and that is the whole gate: a section passes it only when the
 * reading table has an entry for that section, so Similar claims and Documents render the
 * row they always did while `This customer` gets a button. The rule is the table's
 * own (../../../../_components/evidence-capture/evidence-templates.ts): a source
 * earns a reading when somebody has decided what a fact there MEANS as evidence.
 *
 * ## The reveal is state and an inline style, NOT `group-hover:`
 *
 * The obvious version — `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100` — was written, shipped
 * and reported as a bug within the hour: **the button was invisible at every
 * state while still being clickable.** It is the standing hazard ./EvidenceList.tsx
 * describes, and knowing about it was not enough to avoid it, so here is the
 * mechanism concretely.
 *
 * Two stylesheets style this folder. The console's prebuilt one
 * (../../../warranty-console/warranty-console.css) contains `.opacity-0`; the
 * shell's Tailwind build contains `.group-hover\:opacity-100`. Both are one class
 * of specificity, so the winner is whichever sits later in the document — and the
 * console's sheet is loaded after. `opacity: 0` therefore wins on hover too, and
 * no amount of checking that `group-hover:opacity-100` "is emitted" catches it,
 * because it IS emitted; it just loses.
 *
 * So the row tracks its own hover and focus, and the two things that change are
 * written as inline styles, which neither sheet can outvote. It is the same
 * reasoning ../coverage/primitives.tsx gives for writing the chevron's rotation
 * inline, and the same conclusion: in this folder, a value that has to change on
 * an interaction is a style, not a variant.
 *
 * Two things follow from that and both are wanted. **Tab reaches it** without a
 * pointer ever being near the row, and `focus-within` makes the focused one
 * visible.
 *
 * **It stays clickable while transparent, and that is not the oversight it looks
 * like.** The obvious guard is `pointer-events-none` lifted by a
 * `group-hover:pointer-events-auto` — and that variant is NOT emitted in this
 * folder (measured: zero rules in either stylesheet, while every other class on
 * this button is present). It is also not needed: a pointer cannot reach the
 * button without first entering the row, which is what makes it opaque, so the
 * invisible-but-clickable state is unreachable by mouse. The one case it IS
 * reachable in is touch, where there is no hover at all — and a tap at the row's
 * right edge opening the composer is a reasonable affordance rather than a bug.
 * `pointer-events-none` with no way to lift it would break the mouse entirely.
 *
 * ## The value slides rather than being covered
 *
 * `group-hover:pr-[104px]` on the value, so the fact moves aside for the button
 * instead of sitting under it. It is padding rather than a margin or a width so the
 * box's right edge — which the composer anchors to — does not move while the text
 * inside it does.
