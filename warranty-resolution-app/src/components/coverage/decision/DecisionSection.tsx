/**
 * THE DECISION, as a section of the record — after the evidence it rests on, before
 * the history that frames it.
 *
 * Built out of the app's own parts, like the cards above it: a glass `Card` with
 * `p-5` and a `CardHead`, bordered `bg-card` panels rather than tinted wells, the
 * app's `Button` and `Badge`, 14px reading size, and only one figure — the claim's
 * ceiling meter aside, the position is the largest thing on it.
 *
 * ## The strip never changes height
 *
 * A reassessment used to add a line to the body, which grew the box while somebody
 * was reading it. What moved the agent is now a timestamp in the right-hand column
 * under the confidence, in a fixed-height slot that is blank until there is something
 * to say — so the strip measures the same before and after.
 *
 * ## The resolutions are a choicebox
 *
 * The control leads, then the option's name with its "Rec" badge beside it, then
 * what the option means on its own line (../../ui/choicebox.tsx). Three of them
 * share one row. The stacked text is what lets the badge sit beside a name rather
 * than on top of it, and what stops the description truncating to "Cobalt Ridge
 * funds the…".

/**
 * WHOSE POSITION THE HEAD IS SHOWING — "Agent recommended" while the card stands
 * where the agent put it, "Human override" once the reviewer has moved it.
 *
 * **It is the only place either phrase appears.** The marker used to be on the
 * recommended resolution card as well, so the same claim was made twice on one
 * screen — once about the head's position and once about an option in the list —
 * and the two drifted apart the moment a reviewer picked something else: the head
 * dropped its pill while the list went on marking a card that was no longer the
 * decision. One tag, in the head, next to the position it describes.
 *
 * **BOTH STATES CARRY A MARK, and the pair is the vocabulary.** `AiMark` is the
 * app's agent glyph (../../ui/ai-mark.tsx, on nine other surfaces); `UserRound`
 * drawn filled is what an evidence row the reviewer added already wears
 * (../EvidenceList.tsx). The filed record's manifest attributes every line with
 * the same two marks (./FiledRecord.tsx), so a reader learns them once here and
 * reads them there.
 *
 * A mark on the override too, rather than only on the recommendation: they are two
 * values of one field, and a badge that grows an icon when it changes reads as two
 * different components instead of one that moved.
 *
 * **This reverses an earlier removal, because its premise is gone.** The glyph came
 * off on the grounds that "the AI avatar 12px to its left already makes the same
 * mark" — the head used to open with a gradient AI disc. It does not any more: the
 * row is `Decision` / position · direction dot · this tag. With the avatar gone the
 * badge is the only thing on the line that says whose call it is, so the mark has
 * nothing left to duplicate.
 *
 * **The hue is on the mark and the ink is `foreground`, which is a contrast fix
 * with a number on it.** `text-insight-600` on `bg-insight-100` measures 3.86:1 on
 * the running page, under the 4.5:1 that 11px type needs — the same "status ink on
 * a tint of itself" trap ../primitives.tsx `Pill` has a long note about. The insight
 * scale has no darker step available in this scope (`text-insight-700` and up fall
 * through to `--foreground`, and `bg-insight-600` is not emitted at all), so the
 * wash keeps the hue, the LABEL takes the page's own ink — **12.81:1** — and the
 * hue lands on the GLYPH, which is held to 1.4.11's 3:1 for non-text contrast and
 * clears it at 3.86. The colour ends up where it says "agent" and off the text
 * where it was failing.
 *
 * Not the `--ai-gradient` disc the page header and the assessment rail use: that
 * treatment is sized for a 20px avatar beside a heading, and inside an 11px pill it
 * would be a third bordered object on a row that already has a dot and a chip.
 *
 * **Override drops the hue rather than swapping it.** `insight` is the agent's
 * colour everywhere in this app, so tinting the reviewer's own call with it would
 * credit the agent for it; a second hue would read as a warning about a move the
 * reviewer is entitled to make. `bg-muted` is the neutral the dock already uses for
 * the same state — it goes `bg-foreground` / "Your decision" there.
 *
 * **It no longer keeps the chip the same size, and that is fine.** "Agent
 * recommended" is six characters longer than "Human override", so the head does
 * reflow slightly on the first click. The value row is `flex-wrap` with `gap-2`, so
 * the worst case is the badge dropping to its own line under the position — it
 * pushes nothing, and `whitespace-nowrap` keeps each phrase whole.
 *
 * **No tooltip.** It carried "What the agent would decide on this evidence. You can
 * pick any resolution." — an instruction for a control the reader is looking
 * straight at, on a chip that is a marker rather than a question. What it explained
 * is now said by the tag changing when the reviewer acts.

/**
 * THE DECISION'S HEAD — the section's name, what it stands at, and how sure the
 * agent was. Three facts, two ranks, no box.
 *
 * **The eyebrow is the heading.** `Decision` is the `h2` at 10px, which is the
 * rank the app gives a caption, and the 20px line under it is a VALUE, not a
 * title — so the section is still named for a screen reader while the largest
 * thing in the head is the thing a reader came for. `stamp` is the eyebrow's
 * suffix and the only moving part up there: "updating…" while the agent is
 * reassessing, then "updated 14:32" once it has. That used to be a fixed-height
 * slot under the confidence figure, kept blank so the panel could not grow
 * mid-read; there is no panel to grow now, and the eyebrow has the room.
 *
 * ## The score is a figure with a line under it, and both are deliberately quiet
 *
 * **Slate, not teal.** Teal on this card means the primary action and the
 * selected option — `bg-primary` is the submit button and the choicebox ring — so
 * a teal bar in the head would read as something to act on. `muted-foreground` at
 * 60% reads as a measurement, which is what it is.
 *
 * **It dims rather than disappears on a change.** A filled bar is a stronger
 * claim than a number: once the reviewer has picked something else it is not
 * describing the line beside it. Dropping to 35% says so without a caption, and
 * keeps the head the same height either way.
 *
 * **The caption is the page's own `Label`** — 12px, regular weight, sentence
 * case — rather than the 10px bold uppercase this mockup started from. That was
 * the right call for the wrong reason: ../primitives.tsx has since retired
 * uppercase captions altogether and `TYPE.label` IS the gentle form now, so the
 * quiet reading is also the consistent one. It shares a rung with the eyebrow and
 * does not compete with it, because the two sit in different columns.
 *
 * **The figure and the position share one rung** — 18/600, written out rather than
 * taken from `TYPE.page`, which is 20 and still belongs to the page `h1`. They are
 * the head's two readings and neither outranks the other.
 *
 * ## Every class in here was checked on the running page first
 *
 * Not superstition — `bg-foreground/55` and `bg-foreground/10` are BOTH dead in
 * this folder (measured: no rule emitted, background stays transparent), and the
 * second of those is what the reassessment skeleton below was using, so those
 * pulse bars have been painting nothing. They are `bg-muted-foreground/35` here,
 * which does resolve. See ../EvidenceList.tsx on why a class in this folder is
 * only real if one of the two stylesheets already contains it.
 *
 * **The emitted opacity steps are not the ones you would guess.** Measured on
 * `muted-foreground`: `/30`, `/35` and `/60` resolve; `/40` and `/50` do not. So
 * retuning either bar value is a two-minute job with a probe, not a one-character
 * edit — pick a step, then check it actually paints before believing the diff.

          FLEX WITH A FIXED MONEY COLUMN, NOT A RATIO — and the ratio was the first
          three attempts. `lg:grid-cols-[minmax(0,5fr)_minmax(0,7fr)]` computes to a
          SINGLE 1000px column on the running page; `lg:col-span-*`, `w-5/12` and
          `basis-5/12` are not emitted at all; and an unprefixed `col-span-2` inside
          `grid-cols-1` grows an implicit second track, which breaks the stacked
          layout. All measured. ../CaseFacts.tsx hit the same wall and its note
          explains why: an arbitrary value the prebuilt `.wrc` sheet has never seen
          is not reliably generated, so the only safe widths are the ones the app
          already uses. `flex` + `lg:flex-row` + `lg:w-[300px]` + `lg:shrink-0` are
          exactly that set — they are what that card runs on.

          The money holds four short figures and a meter; it does not need half the
          card, and 300px is what it actually needs. The rationale takes the rest,
          which is where the extra typing room comes from. */}

          second is the reason.

          The stated one: the decision is the first thing in this section rather
          than the fourth thing on the page.

          The one that matters more: **the reassessment is now visible while it
          is being caused.** Weighting a row or filing one makes the agent move —
          the strip's position and rule change, the refund changes, the rationale
          is rewritten, a timestamp appears. All of that is rendered ABOVE these
          rows. With the list above the card, every one of those answers landed
          below the reader's scroll position, so the loop ran off screen and the
          rows looked inert.

          `state.evidence` and `dispatch` were already props of this component —
          the reducer feeds the recommendation strip from the same list — so this
          needs no new plumbing and the composer, the row actions and the
          `addedByReviewer` chip behave exactly as they did. */}

 * rewrites the money token of any effect whose detail mentions an accrual and
