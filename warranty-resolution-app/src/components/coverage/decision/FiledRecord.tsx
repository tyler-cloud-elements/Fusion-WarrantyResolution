 * (../../../lib/coverage/store.ts), and a third mark at the row's right edge drew
 * it — `AiMark` against `UserRound`, the head's own pair. It came back out: on a
 * filed record almost every line is the reviewer's, so the column was a stack of
 * the same glyph with an occasional exception in it, and it put a third thing to
 * read on a row whose job is to say what the value used to be. The attribution
 * stays in the data for whatever wants it next; the stamp above still counts it.

/**
 * WHAT KIND OF CHANGE IT WAS — one badge per row, in a column of its own.
 *
 * `+` green for something filed, `−` red for something removed, `○` amber for
 * everything that moved. Three types over six kinds of row, and the third is the
 * common one, which is the right way round: a filed decision mostly consists of
 * things that shifted, and an addition or a removal is the exception worth
 * spotting.
 *
 * **It replaced an inline glyph that typed only half the rows.** A `Plus`, a
 * `Trash2` or a `Pencil` sat in the value cell keyed off `to`, which meant only
 * the three entries with no `from` were marked — a resolution change, a refund
 * change and both evidence moves carried no type at all and had to be inferred
 * from the arrow. Every row is typed now, and one marker replaces the other rather
 * than joining it.
 *
 * **It also took the emphasis off the value.** `to` was `font-semibold`, which is
 * how the row used to say "this is the new one". The badge says it, so the value
 * renders at normal weight and only `subject` stays bold — the row's identity
 * rather than its change.
 *
 * ## The hue is in the rim and the wash, and the ink is neutral
 *
 * Straight off `TONE` (../primitives.tsx), whose note carries the argument and the
 * numbers. Briefly: a hued glyph on a tint of its own hue measures **1.78:1** for
 * the amber one, and solid fills fail too — 4.25:1 for success and 3.92:1 for
 * destructive against white, both under AA, and worse in dark. `foreground` on a
 * wash is 13.2–14.7:1 and is the only treatment that passes on all three.
 *
 * The rim and wash are a step stronger than `ToneChip`'s because this is an 18px
 * square rather than a text pill, and a `/30` rim on it is close to invisible.
 *
 * **THE GLYPH IS THE PRIMARY CUE AND THE COLOUR AGREES WITH IT**, which is not a
 * compromise. The three washes are near-identical in luminance — `+` against `○`
 * is 1.06:1 — so they differ in hue alone, and in greyscale or to a red-green
 * deficient reader the fills are the same. A badge that carried the meaning in
 * colour alone would have been unreadable to those readers; `+` / `○` / `−` is
 * legible without any colour at all.
 *
 * `○` U+25CB rather than a capital O: at 11px the letter is a beat away from a
 * zero and sits on a different optical weight from the two symmetrical strokes it
 * pairs with. `−` U+2212 rather than a hyphen, for the same reason — a hyphen is
 * short and rides high against the `+`.

 * the evidence under it was the LIVE list — still editable, "Add evidence" and
 * all, on a card stamped Decided. The submit bar had just declared four parts; the
 * record showed half of them and let one of those halves keep moving.
 *
 * **So it is the form again, in the order it was filled in.** Resolution, refund
 * and authority, rationale, evidence. Nothing to learn on arrival and nothing to
 * hunt for: each value sits where it was typed, which is the whole argument for
 * this shape over a differently-organised receipt. The unchosen resolutions stay
 * on screen, dimmed, because "one of three" is part of what was decided — and the
 * one the agent opened on is marked, so the record says where it started without
 * anybody reading the manifest.
 *
 * **`What changed` is last, and outside the form.** It was above it, on the
 * argument that a reader wants "did anybody depart from the machine, and who"
 * before the values — but that is an edit history in front of the decision it
 * edited, and the record already answers the same question in its stamp. The
 * values first, then how they got there.
 *
 * Attribution is still the point of the panel rather than decoration on it: on
 * this fixture a reviewer who re-weights one row moves the agent, which then
 * rewrites the resolution, the refund and the rationale, and a manifest that
 * credited all four to the person would be wrong about three.
 *
 * **Read-only, and that is a behaviour change made on purpose.** The list was
 * editable after a decision before, defended on the grounds that it had always
 * been. That held while the evidence sat in another card and was not part of what
 * the button submitted. It stopped holding when the bar started naming the
 * evidence in the payload: a record that can be edited after it is signed is not a
 * record. `Reopen` is the way back, and it is unchanged.

/**
 * The evidence as it was submitted — the same row grammar, without the controls.
 *
 * THE EVIDENCE, AND NOTHING ABOUT WHO MOVED IT. Rows the reviewer touched used
 * to carry a "you: Low → High" marker, built by filtering the same `changes`
 * array the What changed block below reads. Two tellings of one fact, and this
 * was the lossy one: only `part === "Evidence"` entries could produce a marker,
 * so a record whose resolution, refund and rationale all moved showed markers on
 * none of them and a reader could not tell whether the list meant "these are the
 * changes" or "these are some of them".
 *
 * ## The rows open, and losing that was the regression
 *
 * Before submitting, every evidence row is a disclosure — press it and the note,
 * what it backs and where it came from appear (../EvidenceList.tsx). Filing froze
 * the list into flat lines, so the moment a decision was signed the reasoning
 * behind each item became unreadable. That is backwards: the filed record is the
 * version somebody comes back to, and "what did this rest on" is exactly the
 * question they arrive with.
 *
 * **Read-only, still.** Opening a row shows what it said; it does not bring back
 * the selects, the edit or the remove. Freezing the list was right — a record that
 * can be changed after it is signed is not a record — but freezing it was never
 * meant to mean hiding it.
 *
 * **A row with nothing to show is not a button.** Same rule the live list keeps: a
 * control that opens nothing is worse than no control.
 *
 * The open state is React's and the chevron's rotation is an inline transform, for
 * the reason ../primitives.tsx gives at length — in this folder a value that
 * changes on an interaction cannot safely be a variant class.
