 * (`reasonHistory`), which is also why the rewrite can stay instant: nothing is
 * lost, so nothing has to be confirmed.
 *
 * **It could not say who wrote what**, which was the whole point of the exercise
 * and the thing an earlier pass of mine left out. Two mechanisms now, because they
 * answer different questions and only one of them can be always-on:
 *
 *   - **Inline, unprompted.** Your words carry a wash the moment you type them,
 *     compared against the draft you started over. It cannot show a REMOVAL —
 *     deleted words are not there to mark, and making space for them inside a
 *     field being typed in would move the cursor around while somebody works.
 *   - **`⇄`, on demand.** Freezes the field and shows the full comparison, both
 *     directions, against whichever version the picker names.
 *
 * **The header says as little as it can, and never changes shape.** Nothing at
 * all on an untouched draft; afterwards the time it last changed, the compare
 * button, and a picker — the same three whether the agent is writing or not. No
 * authorship chips, no captions, no spinner.

   * here, and each was doing a job something else already does:
   *
   * **The colour.** The label was `text-warning` for a version you wrote and
   * `text-primary` for one the agent drafted — and `label` is already the words
   * "You" or "Auto". A hue restating a word it sits inside is a third green/amber
   * system on a screen that just gave up two.
   *
   * **The selected row's `bg-primary/5` wash.** No other menu in this card tints
   * its selection. A wash plus a tick is the selection said twice.
   *
   * **A `✓` character held at `opacity-0` on every unselected row.** That
   * reserved a 12px column down the list so the labels would not shift — but the
   * evidence menu puts a real lucide `Check` at the END and lets the rows be as
   * wide as they are, and the two menus sat six pixels apart looking like
   * different components.
   *
   * **`font-medium` on the label**, which made these heavier than the evidence
   * rows now that those are uniform.
   *
   * What is kept is the timestamp, muted and trailing: it is the one thing here
   * the evidence menu has no equivalent for, and "You · 2:14 PM" is how a reader
   * tells two of their own edits apart.

       The two menus were structurally different: those open with an 18px icon
       column before the label, this one started hard against the padding. Side by
       side they read as different components, and the selected row read as a
       different KIND of selection — which is what made the tick here look like it
       meant something else.
       The slot holds the tick. Both menus mark the selection with a `Check` in
       `text-primary`; putting it at the head of the row rather than the tail is what
       makes it land in the icon column the evidence rows already have, so the mark
       sits in the same place in both. */

   * ## The bug this fixes
   *
   * The panel is a flex column in a row whose height is set by whichever column is
   * taller — and since the Amount panel beside it grows when the Breakdown opens,
   * that is often the money. The rationale's box then stretched with the panel and
   * the textarea inside it did not, because `fit()` wrote an exact pixel height
   * onto the textarea: a field sitting in the top 128px of a 190px box, with the
   * rest of the box empty. Reported, and reproduced.
   *
   * ## Why the measurement moves rather than goes
   *
   * Auto-sizing is still right — the box should never be SHORTER than its text —
   * so the measured height becomes the box's `minHeight` and the field is told to
   * fill whatever the box ends up being. Two consequences, both wanted: spare
   * height in the row goes to the field, and content taller than the spare height
   * still pushes the box out to fit.
   *
   * Only the live field grows. A superseded revision is `height`-pinned by the
   * panel so every version reads at the same size, and that branch is untouched.

   * FOCUS AS STATE, because the variant that should have done this does not exist.
   *
   * The box is drawn by the wrapper — it has to be, since the textarea is
   * transparent and the mirror sits behind it — so the focus ring wanted
   * `focus-within:` on that wrapper. Measured on the running page, it produced a
   * **hard near-black 3px ring and no border change**, against the teal border and
   * soft 50% teal ring every other field on the card gets.
   *
   * The cause is this app's prebuilt stylesheet
   * (../../../../warranty-console/warranty-console.css), which carries no
   * `focus-within:*` utilities: `focus-within:ring-[3px]` is an arbitrary value so
   * Tailwind emitted it, while `focus-within:ring-ring` and
   * `focus-within:border-ring` did not — leaving a ring at v4's default colour,
   * which is `currentColor`. The measured ring was exactly the foreground token.
   *
   * So the state is tracked in React and the classes applied are plain, static
   * ones — the same three the refund field uses behind `focus-visible:`, which do
   * resolve. This is the same workaround the chevron rotation and the row hover
   * take elsewhere in this folder, and for the same reason.
