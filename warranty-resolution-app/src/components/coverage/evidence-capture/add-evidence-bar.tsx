/**
 * ADD THIS AS EVIDENCE — the bar that appears over a selection on the coverage
 * decision screen.
 *
 * One act, not a menu of them. The cartographer document's selection toolbar
 * offers two verbs and a conversation picker, because a reader of a process map
 * might be commenting, quoting or asking. A reader of a claim who has just dragged
 * across a paragraph of the finding is doing one thing: saying "this belongs in the
 * record". So the bar is that one button, and the second step is the only thing it
 * still needs from them — what the evidence IS.
 *
 * This shares no code with that toolbar and is not meant to
 * (./use-screen-selection.ts says why at length). Same gesture, different surface,
 * different act.
 *
 * ## Two states, one object
 *
 * **Resting** — `Add evidence`, and the selection echoed under it. A floating bar
 * carrying a verb and no subject makes the reader trust their own memory of a drag
 * that is very easy to overshoot, so the subject is on screen.
 *
 * **Composing** — the same bar, in place, becomes a one-line field for the title. In place rather than a dialog: a modal over the thing you just
 * selected hides the thing you just selected, and this bar is anchored to it for a
 * reason. Enter commits, Escape backs out to resting.
 *
 * The blue wash goes when the reader clicks into the bar — the browser collapses a
 * selection on a press outside it, and nothing here fights that. The captured text
 * is already held in state by then, so nothing is lost but the highlight, which is
 * the other reason the echo line under the bar exists: while the field is open it is
 * the only thing still showing what this is about.
 *
 * ## Tokens
 *
 * The console's own — `bg-card`, `border-border`, `bg-primary`, `text-muted-
 * foreground` — and not the shell's `app-*` family, even though this file lives in
 * the shell's folder. It renders inside `.wrc`, which is the embedded app's theme
 * root, and shell token names fall through to the shell's LIGHT values in there and
 * stay: a near-white chip on a near-black card. The bridge block in app/globals.css
 * re-points a handful of them for controls that had no choice; this one has a
 * choice, so it takes it.
