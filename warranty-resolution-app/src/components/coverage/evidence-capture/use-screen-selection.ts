/**
 * WHAT THE READER JUST DRAGGED ACROSS — the text and where it is on screen.
 *
 * The producer half of the Add-evidence bar (./add-evidence-bar.tsx). It watches
 * one element for a completed drag and reports the selection, or `null` when there
 * isn't one.
 *
 * ## Deliberately NOT the cartographer document's version
 *
 * That surface has a selection toolbar too, and this file shares no code with it
 * on purpose (components/cartographer/process-selection-toolbar.tsx,
 * lib/cartographer/quote-marks.ts). The difference is not stylistic. Its
 * `markFromSelection` builds a normalised text index over the whole document and
 * resolves the drag to an `nth` occurrence of a string, so the same passage can be
 * found again later and painted as a persistent highlight. Nothing here highlights
 * anything and nothing here persists, so all of that machinery would be weight
 * carried for a feature that does not exist — and a shared helper would be a seam
 * where one surface's needs start bending the other's.
 *
 * What this needs is the text and a rectangle. That is the whole contract.
 *
 * ## A drag across CARDS, not a paragraph
 *
 * The reader is expected to sweep whole rows, figures and cards rather than pick
 * out a sentence, and a native selection handles that without being asked to:
 * `toString()` concatenates whatever text fell inside the range, and the range's
 * bounding box covers the region rather than a line. So "select a bigger chunk"
 * needs no marquee — it is the ordinary gesture, used coarsely.
 *
 * The consequence worth knowing: the text of a multi-card drag is run-together
 * content from several elements, which is fine as a record of what was pointed at
 * and useless as a quotation. The bar treats it as the former.
 *
 * ## The one prerequisite
 *
 * The app is `select-none` at the body (app/layout.tsx — the desktop convention, so
 * dragging across the shell doesn't blue-wash a sidebar). A region that wants this
 * hook has to opt back in with `select-text`, or there will never be a selection to
 * report and the bar will never appear. That is not a bug to hunt later; it is the
 * switch that turns this on.
