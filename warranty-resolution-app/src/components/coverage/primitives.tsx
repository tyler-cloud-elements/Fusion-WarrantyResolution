/**
 * THE PAGE'S SCALE — WHICH IS NOW THE APP'S SCALE, in one place.
 *
 * This file used to hold a design system of its own: seven type rungs, a bespoke
 * `Pill`, an opaque 14px-radius card, a tinted band, and a 10px uppercase
 * micro-label as the page's dominant caption. It looked considered on its own and
 * it looked foreign next to every other screen in warranty resolution, because
 * none of those five things exist anywhere else in the app.
 *
 * So each of them is now a thin adapter over the app's own component:
 *
 *   `Card`    → `GLASS_CLASSES` from ../ui/card.tsx (the glass every other card is)
 *   `Pill`    → `ToneChip` below (a tinted-outline pill, 12px, six tones)
 *   `TYPE`    → the app's own six rungs, below
 *   `Band`    → a hairline sub-head, no tint
 *   `Label`   → a 12px caption, sentence case
 *
 * The export names and signatures did NOT change, which is the whole point of
 * doing it here: the eight components that read from this file compile unchanged,
 * and the ones that needed more than a re-skin were edited on their own terms.

/**
 * SIX RUNGS, AND THEY ARE THE APP'S — 12 · 14 · 16 · 24, plus the 11px mono stamp
 * and the 10px the odd chip resolves to.
 *
 * Measured off the case detail page: every leaf element there renders at 10, 11,
 * 12, 14, 16 or 24px. This page had ten sizes, four of which (13, 13.5, 15, 20)
 * exist nowhere else — and 13 vs 13.5 vs 14 is three rungs inside a pixel and a
 * half, which the eye cannot resolve and which therefore carried no meaning.
 *
 * The names are unchanged so no call site had to move. What each one now means:
 *
 *   label   12px               a caption. NOT uppercase — the app has no
 *                              uppercase micro-label, and this page had ~30 of them
 *   meta    11px mono          ids, stamps, sources, counts
 *   small   12px               captions and meta prose
 *   body    14px               everything a reviewer reads
 *   title   16px semibold      a card's or a section's own heading
 *   page    20px semibold      the one h1 (see its own note below)
