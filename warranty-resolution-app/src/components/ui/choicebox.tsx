/**
 * CHOICEBOX — a group of option cards, each with a title, a description and its own
 * control, selected by border and tint.
 *
 * Adapted rather than pasted. Three things about the source did not belong here:
 *
 * 1. **`clsx` is not a dependency of this app** — `cn` (../../lib/utils.ts) is the
 *    same job plus tailwind-merge, and it is what every other component uses.
 * 2. **The `--ds-blue-*` / `--ds-gray-*` palette is not this app's.** Adding it would
 *    put a second source of colour beside the theme and break both dark mode and
 *    `docs/theme-rules.md`. Every value here is a semantic token — `primary`,
 *    `border`, `muted-foreground` — so the group themes with the rest of the console.
 * 3. **The control is a real input, always.** The source hides one and paints a
 *    `<span>`; keeping the input as the thing that is checked (visually hidden, not
 *    absolutely positioned) is what makes arrow keys, form association and screen
 *    readers work without a second implementation.
 *
 * Radio and checkbox both, `row` or `column`, and an optional `badge` slot beside the
 * title — which is why the resolution row can carry "Recommended" without it landing
 * on top of the option's own name.
