 * The path prefix this app is mounted at.

 *
 *   <base href="/maestro-case-app/">
 *   <meta name="uipath:app-base" content="/maestro-case-app">
 *
 * Locally and on Vercel the app is served from the domain root, no meta tag is
 * present, and this returns "/", so the same build works in all three places.
 *
 * This mirrors `getAppBase()` from `@uipath/uipath-typescript`. It's hand-rolled
 * because that package is the full UiPath SDK and this prototype makes no UiPath
 * API calls (and the repo's .npmrc redirects the @uipath scope to a gated feed).
 * If real UiPath data wiring ever lands, swap this for the SDK's version.
