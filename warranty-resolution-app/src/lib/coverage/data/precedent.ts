/**
 * WHAT OTHERS DECIDED — how claims like this one have gone before.
 *
 * The third thing the agent says. Not evidence about THIS case (that is
 * ./decision-signals.ts) and not the position itself (./coverage-decision.ts):
 * this is the base rate, and it answers a question neither of those can — "is
 * what I am about to do normal?"
 *
 * **The distribution is over the console's own three positions**, keyed by
 * `CoverageOptionId`, rather than over three strings written out here. That is the
 * whole reason the type is imported: a precedent list that could name a fourth
 * position, or spell one differently, would be a second vocabulary for the same
 * three choices — and the readout labels each row with the option's own `action`
 * text, so the words in the chat are the words on the submit button.
 *
 * **Counts, not percentages.** The percentages are the reading, and a reading is
 * derived: authoring both is how a widget ends up printing three shares that do
 * not add to a hundred. `shareOf` is the only place a percentage is worked out.
 *
 * **Authored, and honestly so.** These are invented figures for one invented
 * estate — there is no decision history behind the prototype to count. What they
 * are FOR is the shape of the claim: a clear majority landing where the agent
 * landed, with a real minority that did not, so that the readout is neither
 * decorative nor visibly unsupported.
 *
 * **WR-2026-0417's counts are tied to its customer record.** `This customer` on the
 * coverage decision page states six claims in 24 months, all approved and none
 * contested, and this distribution has to be able to be the same six: four partial,
 * two full, no denials. Two widgets printing different histories of one account is
 * the kind of thing a reader notices immediately. If either number moves, move both
 * — the customer row is `history` in
 * ../_views/warranty-console-v2/app/lib/coverage/fixture.ts.
