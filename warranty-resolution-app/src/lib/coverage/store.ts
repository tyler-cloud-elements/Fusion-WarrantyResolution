 * all four, so the screen changed the reviewer's answer for them on the strength of
 * a row they had merely re-read. **The position is the reviewer's now.** The agent
 * recommends once, at load, and then only ever rewrites — the amount follows the
 * resolution the reviewer picks, and nothing else moves it.
 *
 * **And the paragraph evolves rather than swaps.** Five slots (../coverage/fixture.ts
 * authors the words), most holding the same point at two or three lengths, and a
 * single rule choosing between them: a slot goes shorter as the slots below it fill.
 * So weighting the renewal adds its sentence AND fuses the two above it; signing the
 * decision retires both commercial clauses into five words and appends the split.
 * The paragraph peaks at 330 characters and the final one is 297 — appending the
 * same four clauses and rewriting nothing would have landed at 526.
 *
 * Two things fall out of assembling rather than accumulating, neither of them coded:
 *
 *   - **Evidence the slots do not name does nothing.** Re-weight the defect, edit a
 *     source, remove a row — the assembled string is byte-identical, `reassess`
 *     returns the state untouched, and no revision, timestamp or "Rewriting" beat
 *     fires. The agent not reacting is TRUE here, not merely invisible.
 *   - **Undo is free.** Put the renewal back to Low and its sentence leaves *and the
 *     earlier phrasings come back*, because no phrasing was ever stored. Going back
 *     to the recommendation drops the signature the same way.
 *
 * `pressure` is the whole mechanism: one small integer standing for "how much has
 * been said since the case opened", read by the two slots that contract.

 * over it. Comparing against the assembly is what lets an evidence change no slot
 * names pass through without eating that edit — and what makes the beat fire exactly
 * when the agent has something new to say.
 *
 * **When it does move, it overwrites.** The superseded value goes to

 * click away in the panel's picker rather than gone, and `reasonReviewed` goes false
