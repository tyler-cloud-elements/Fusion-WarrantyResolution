  //   so relative paths resolve correctly at any route depth. An absolute base
  //   would 404 there.

  // • Root hosting — local preview (`npm run build`) → "/". There is no injected
  //   <base href>, so "./" would resolve against the current URL: a hard refresh
  //   on /cases/WR-2026-0417 would request /cases/assets/index.js, which the SPA
  //   fallback answers with index.html as text/html and the browser rejects as a
  //   module — a blank page.
